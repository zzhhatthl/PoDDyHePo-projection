PoDDyHePoPlot(
  data,
  year,
  grplabels = c("Men", "Women"),

  y_min,
  y_max,
  sepvarlbl = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame from PoDDyHePoPool.}

\item{year}{The maximum year in the observed data.}

\item{grplabels}{The labels of grouping variable. By default, grplabels = c("Men", "Women").}

\item{title}{The tile of the plot. It changes due to we will have different response variable.}

\item{y_min}{minimum value of y-axis(in percentage). For example, if 10 percent is the minimum value of y-axis, then type let y_min = 10.}

\item{y_max}{maximum value of y-axis(in percentage). Let y_max = 75, if 75 percent is the maximum value of y-axis.}

\item{sepvarlbl}{Label of the variable whose proportion of each category has been calculated. The default is \code{NULL}. According to dummy_cols, the separated variables will be in the name for example obe_0, obe_1, obe_2, if we taking obe for example. To label, sepvarlbl = c("Normal Weight", "Over Weight", "Obesity").
